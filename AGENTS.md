# AGENTS.md

Guidance for AI coding agents (and humans) working **on** aicontainer itself.
For users running aicontainer in their projects, the entry point is `README.md`.

`CLAUDE.md` is a thin pointer to this file — keep that arrangement. New
agent-facing notes go here, not in `CLAUDE.md`.

## Repository layout

- `aic` — the host-side bash CLI. Single file. Sourced from npm bin (`aic`,
  `aicontainer`) and from `~/.aicontainer/aic` for git installs. Resolves its
  template via `$AIC_HOME` (defaults to the script's directory after
  symlink-following).
- `template/` — files copied into a project's `.devcontainer/` by `aic init`
  and `aic sync`. The canonical source of truth for what ends up in a user's
  repo.
  - `Dockerfile`, `post-create.py`, `hooks/`, `aic-firewall`,
    `aic-chown-volumes`, `aic-lock-gitconfig`, `.zshrc`
  - `hooks/` holds the shared guardrail `pre-tool-use.sh` (Claude + Codex) plus
    `opencode-guardrail.js`, the thin OpenCode plugin that shells out to it — all
    copied root-owned to `/etc/aic/hooks/` (Dockerfile chmods `*.sh`/`*.json`/`*.js`).
  - `docker-compose.pull.yml` — default (pull) mode
  - `docker-compose.build.yml` — `--build` mode
  - `README.md` — copied into every project's `.devcontainer/` in **both**
    modes (unconditional `cp` in `apply_template()`, before the mode `case`).
    A managed/overwritten guide to the do-not-edit vs project-owned split, aimed
    at stopping humans and AI agents from hand-editing `devcontainer.json`. Keep
    its two lists in sync with `apply_template()` and the project-owned files.
- `.github/workflows/`
  - `rebuild.yml` — **security-refresh track.** Runs on template-touching
    pushes to `main`, the weekly cron, and `workflow_dispatch`. Publishes
    `ghcr.io/stefanoginella/aicontainer:latest` and `:weekly-YYYY-VV`.
    Does not publish to npm.
  - `release.yml` — **release track.** Runs only on `v*` tag push (or
    `workflow_dispatch` against a tag ref). Publishes immutable
    `:vX.Y.Z` + `:latest` to GHCR and `aicontainer@X.Y.Z` to npm with
    provenance attestation.
- `package.json` — npm metadata. Its `version` field is the source of truth
  for the GHCR image tag pinned by `aic init`. Do not edit it by hand for a
  release; use `npm version`, whose `preversion`/`version` scripts promote the
  changelog (see "Releasing").
- `CHANGELOG.md` — hand-maintained ([Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/)
  format). Source of the GitHub Release notes, and a release precondition (see
  "Releasing").
- `scripts/promote-changelog.mjs` — zero-dep release helper run by `npm
  version`: promotes the hand-written `## [Unreleased]` section to the new
  version (date + compare links). It does **not** generate content.
- `.githooks/pre-push` — local mirror of the CI changelog gate; opt-in via
  `git config core.hooksPath .githooks`.

## How image tag pinning works (read before editing the CLI)

`aic init` (pull mode) and `aic sync` (pull mode) write
`ghcr.io/stefanoginella/aicontainer:vX.Y.Z` into the generated
`.devcontainer/docker-compose.yml`, where `X.Y.Z` is the installed aic's
`package.json` version, read via `read_aic_version()` in the `aic` script.

The mechanism:

1. `template/docker-compose.pull.yml` ships with the literal placeholder
   `ghcr.io/stefanoginella/aicontainer:latest` (three occurrences: two
   comments + the actual `image:` line).
2. `apply_template()` copies the file, then sed-rewrites every occurrence to
   `:vX.Y.Z`.
3. The user's resulting compose file is pinned; the template stays canonical
   with `:latest`.

**Do not** hand-edit `template/docker-compose.pull.yml` to use a pinned tag —
keep `:latest` as the placeholder so the rewrite remains idempotent and `aic
sync` can re-pin to a new version cleanly.

If you change the GHCR repo path (`stefanoginella/aicontainer`), update **all
of**: the template (`docker-compose.pull.yml`), the sed pattern in
`apply_template()` inside `aic`, the README's GHCR references, the
`aic-firewall` allowlist's `ghcr.io` entry, and both workflows' image tags.

## Project-owned override files (don't break the auto-wire)

`apply_template()` overwrites `devcontainer.json` and `docker-compose.yml`
wholesale on every `init`/`sync`; only `AIC_TOOLS` / `AIC_SHELL` survive (they
are re-derived from the old file and re-injected by `patch_devcontainer_json`).
So users must **not** hand-edit those two files — per-project tweaks go in
project-owned files that `apply_template()` never touches: `Dockerfile.project`,
`firewall-allowlist`, `chown-paths`, `post-create.project.sh`,
`docker-compose.override.yml`, `vscode-extensions`, and `vscode-settings.json`.

The override is the sync-safe home for anything that would otherwise live in
`containerEnv` or the compose service (env, `extra_hosts`, mounts, a
`build:` block for `Dockerfile.project`). The mechanism:

1. The template's `devcontainer.json` ships `"dockerComposeFile":
   ["docker-compose.yml"]` (single entry — the canonical placeholder).
2. `patch_devcontainer_json()` appends `"docker-compose.override.yml"` to that
   array **only when `.devcontainer/docker-compose.override.yml` exists**. The
   append is guarded against double-wiring, so it stays idempotent across syncs.

Keep the template's array single-entry — do not pre-list the override there, or
`devcontainer up` fails on projects that don't have the file (a missing
`dockerComposeFile` entry is a hard error). The wiring is opt-in by file
presence, mirroring how `firewall-allowlist` is read only if present.

`chown-paths` is the companion to override-declared **named volumes**. Docker
inits a fresh named volume `root:root` and `updateRemoteUserUID` doesn't touch
the daemon's init UID, so a `myproject-venv:/workspace/.venv` mount lands
unwritable by `vscode`. A project lists such mountpoints (one per line) in
`.devcontainer/chown-paths`; `post-create.py`'s `fix_volume_ownership()` then
re-owns them via `aic-chown-volumes` on container creation. Same opt-in-by-
presence, read-only-inside-container, survives-sync contract as
`firewall-allowlist`. **The prefix allowlist (`/workspace/`,
`/home/vscode/.cache/`) is the security boundary — see "Security stance"
before widening it.**

`post-create.project.sh` is the project-owned extension point for
`post-create.py` itself. `run_project_hook()` runs
`.devcontainer/post-create.project.sh` (via `bash <file>`, cwd `/workspace`,
as `vscode`) **last** in `main()`, after every aic-managed step, so a
project's `lefthook install` / `npm ci` sees a fully wired environment. Same
opt-in-by-presence / survives-sync / read-only-inside-container contract as
the files above. It's the only way to extend post-create in **pull mode**,
where `post-create.py` is baked into the image and absent from the repo —
`apply_template()` only copies it in `--build` mode. Security-wise it's lower
stakes than it looks: it runs unprivileged (no grant the in-container agent
lacks) and the PreToolUse hook blocks in-container writes to `.devcontainer/`,
so it stays host-only-editable. Non-zero exit is logged, not fatal — keep that
defensive degradation; a flaky project step shouldn't block the devcontainer
from coming up.

`vscode-extensions` / `vscode-settings.json` are the sync-safe home for
per-project **editor** customization, since `apply_template()` rewrites
`devcontainer.json` (and its `customizations.vscode` block) wholesale every
sync. Same opt-in-by-presence / survives-sync / read-only-inside-container
contract as the files above. `patch_devcontainer_json()` merges them at two
JSONC **marker comments** baked into `template/devcontainer.json`
(`// aic:vscode-extensions` inside the extensions array,
`// aic:vscode-settings` inside the settings object) — `build_vscode_ext_block`
/ `build_vscode_settings_block` emit **leading-comma** blocks so the result is
valid JSON no matter how the template array/object ends, and a JSONC trailing
comma is tolerated before the closing brace. Load-bearing details, don't undo
them: (1) **keep the markers** — they're the injection anchors; removing them
silently drops the merge. (2) The merge re-reads the source files from the
pristine template on every run, so it's **idempotent** across syncs — don't
"optimize" it into editing in place. (3) Extension lines are validated against
the `publisher.name` grammar and **warn+skipped** otherwise (mirrors
`chown-paths`), and the settings file must be a JSON object whose inner content
is injected **verbatim** — both go into the host-side `devcontainer.json` the
user reviews via `git diff`, never into the container, so this isn't a sandbox-
escape surface, but keep the id validation so a stray line can't smuggle JSON.
(4) On a key collision aic's own settings win *inside* `devcontainer.json`
(injected first); the documented escape hatch is the user's own
`.vscode/settings.json`, which beats devcontainer machine-scope settings — don't
reorder the injection to "make project win" without updating the README. The
"aic sync merges project-owned vscode-extensions / vscode-settings.json" CLI
test in both workflows guards this — extend it, don't weaken it.

**AI-tool refresh on every create.** `refresh_ai_tools()` runs early in
`main()` and floats Claude Code + Codex + OpenCode to their latest release on
every container (re)create — so a plain `aic rebuild` lands current CLIs without
a new image. The Dockerfile bakes each as an offline *floor*; this updates them
in place via `claude update` / `codex update` / `opencode upgrade`. It's
`AIC_TOOLS`-gated, fail-soft (an offline/failed update keeps the baked version —
don't make it fatal), and opt-out via `AIC_FREEZE_TOOLS=1` for a reproducible
sandbox. The updaters MUST run with their bin dir on `PATH` (`~/.local/bin` for
Claude/Codex, `~/.opencode/bin` for OpenCode — both are prepended to the env
`refresh_ai_tools()` builds): `codex update` re-runs the official installer,
which otherwise tries to edit a login-shell rc file (root-locked at runtime by
`aic-lock-gitconfig`) and fails — with the bin dir already on PATH it skips that
step. OpenCode is installed with `--no-modify-path` and `opencode upgrade`
replaces the binary in place, so it doesn't touch the rc files at all. The "tool
self-update works with rc files root-locked" smoke test (both workflows) guards
exactly this; don't weaken it.

**Dockerfile.project base-tag drift.** Because `Dockerfile.project` is
project-owned, `aic sync` re-pins `docker-compose.yml` to the new aic version
but does **not** touch a `FROM ghcr.io/stefanoginella/aicontainer:vX.Y.Z` inside
it — so after `npm update -g aicontainer` the two silently diverge, and when an
override's `build:` points at `Dockerfile.project`, that stale `FROM` is what
actually runs (the compose `image:` pin is bypassed). This bit a real project
(container came up on an old base with none of the new template behavior).
`check_dockerfile_project_base()` (called at the end of `cmd_sync`) detects the
drift and **warns**; `aic sync --bump-base` rewrites the tag in place. It only
acts on a literal version pin — `:latest` floats, `ARG`-templated bases, and
other repos are left alone (deliberate choices). Keep the warn/opt-in split:
silently editing a project-owned file would break the ownership contract above.
The "aic sync warns on / bumps a stale Dockerfile.project base" CLI test in both
workflows guards this — extend it, don't weaken it.

## Releasing

See README.md's "Releasing" section for the user-visible flow. **When asked to
cut/trigger a release, do exactly this:**

1. **Clean, current `main`:** `git checkout main && git pull`; working tree
   clean. Releases go from `main`.
2. **Ensure this release's notes are under `## [Unreleased]` in CHANGELOG.md.**
   They should already be there (added as changes landed). If `[Unreleased]` is
   empty or stale, write them **by hand** from `git log <last-tag>..HEAD`,
   grouped under Keep-a-Changelog headings (Added/Changed/Fixed/Removed), and
   commit. Do **not** rename the heading or add the date — `npm version` does
   that. Never auto-generate the prose from commits (tried, reverted, disliked).
3. **Pick the bump** (patch/minor/major) per README's "Picking the bump".
4. **If `template/` changed since the last release, sync the dogfood
   devcontainer:** run `aic sync` **from the host** (never inside the container —
   the PreToolUse hook blocks `.devcontainer/` writes) and commit the resulting
   `.devcontainer/` changes. The dogfood is build-mode, so `.devcontainer/`
   holds copies of `template/`; skipping this leaves it drifted.
5. **Cut it:** `npm version <bump> && git push --follow-tags`.

> **Gotcha — `npm version` silently skips changelog promotion when npm has
> `ignore-scripts=true`.** The aicontainer sandbox image sets `npm config set
> ignore-scripts true` (hardening: don't run arbitrary package install
> scripts). That config *also* suppresses the `preversion`/`version` lifecycle
> hooks below, so `npm version` bumps `package.json` but **never runs
> `promote-changelog.mjs`** — the bump commit ships with `package.json` only and
> no `## [X.Y.Z]` section, which then fails the `.githooks/pre-push` gate and the
> `release.yml` CHANGELOG check. Check with `npm config get ignore-scripts`. If
> it's `true`, cut the release with scripts enabled for that one command:
> `npm version <bump> --ignore-scripts=false && git push --follow-tags`. (Don't
> globally `npm config set ignore-scripts false` — that weakens the image
> default.) If you've already run a plain `npm version` and the bump commit is
> still **local** (not pushed), recover without redoing it: run `node
> scripts/promote-changelog.mjs` by hand, `git commit --amend` to fold the
> promoted `CHANGELOG.md` into the bump commit, `git tag -f -a vX.Y.Z -m X.Y.Z`
> to move the (annotated) tag, then push — this is what was done for v0.1.4.

`npm version` runs two lifecycle scripts (see `package.json`) — **unless
`ignore-scripts=true` suppresses them; see the gotcha above:**

- `preversion` → `promote-changelog.mjs --check`: aborts the bump *before*
  package.json is touched if `[Unreleased]` is empty — you can't release
  nothing, and a failed attempt leaves the tree clean.
- `version` → `promote-changelog.mjs`: promotes the hand-written `[Unreleased]`
  section to `## [X.Y.Z] - <date>`, opens a fresh empty `[Unreleased]`, fixes
  the compare links, and `git add`s CHANGELOG.md so it lands in the bump commit
  and ships on the tag.

`release.yml` then fires on the tag: builds + pushes GHCR `:vX.Y.Z`/`:latest`,
publishes npm with provenance, and (the `github-release` job) creates the GitHub
Release from the tag's `## [X.Y.Z]` CHANGELOG section.

Internal notes:

- The bump commit on `main` touches only `package.json` + `CHANGELOG.md` —
  neither in `rebuild.yml`'s `paths:` filter — so a release push that contains
  **only** the bump commit fires `release.yml` alone. **But merge a
  template-touching feature and release in the *same* push** (e.g.
  `git merge feat… && npm version && git push --follow-tags` back-to-back) and
  the push range to `main` includes the feature commit, so `rebuild.yml` *also*
  fires — two workflows build the same tree and both race to push `:latest`
  (harmless: identical content, last-writer-wins; but ~7 min wasted). GitHub
  evaluates `paths:` across *every* commit in a push, not just HEAD, which is
  why the feature commit drags rebuild along. **Avoid it by separating the
  pushes:** land the feature via PR first (rebuild runs at merge), *then* run
  `npm version && git push --follow-tags` as its own push (bump commit only →
  only `release.yml` fires). v0.0.9 was released the combined way and did
  double-run; it's wasteful, not wrong.
- **Concurrency guards** (top of each workflow). `rebuild.yml`:
  `cancel-in-progress: true` — a newer push to the same ref supersedes an
  in-flight rebuild (safe; `:latest`/`:weekly` are mutable and the newer run
  re-pushes them). `release.yml`: `cancel-in-progress: false`, grouped per tag —
  serialize, **never** cancel a run mid-publish (a kill between the GHCR push and
  `npm publish` could leave a partial release). Keep release uncancellable; do
  not "simplify" the two into one shared group, which could cancel a release.
- `release.yml`'s "Verify tag matches package.json" step fails fast if you
  mint a tag manually that doesn't match. Use `npm version`.
- Do not run `npm publish` locally. CI uses `--provenance`; manual publishes
  skip the supply-chain attestation users can verify.
- **CHANGELOG.md content is hand-written, never generated.** You author notes
  under `## [Unreleased]`; `scripts/promote-changelog.mjs` only relabels them at
  release time. The CI gate (`release.yml` "Verify CHANGELOG.md has an entry")
  greps for `^## [X.Y.Z]` before any GHCR/npm push and fails the release if it's
  missing; `.githooks/pre-push` mirrors it locally (opt-in, bypassable — **CI is
  the real gate; don't weaken that step**). Keep the `## [X.Y.Z]` heading format:
  the gate, the promotion script, and the release-notes extraction all key on it.
- **The GitHub Release is automatic.** `release.yml`'s `github-release` job
  (`needs: [publish]`, so it only runs after GHCR + npm succeed) extracts the
  tag's `## [X.Y.Z]` section from `CHANGELOG.md` and creates the Release via
  `gh`. It's idempotent (skips if the Release exists) and falls back to
  `--generate-notes` if no section is found. This is why the job needs
  `contents: write` while `publish` stays `contents: read`. Releases v0.0.1–
  v0.0.7 were created by hand before this existed; v0.0.8+ are automatic.

## CHANGELOG entry style

`[Unreleased]` bullets are written to be skimmed. Apply this to every new entry
(the conventions `auto-bmad` uses, adopted here):

- **One change = one bullet** under one heading. Never bundle — if you're
  writing "three reinforcing fixes," that's three bullets.
- **Bold headline first, ≤ ~12 words, stating the user-visible effect**
  ("`aic sync` no longer clobbers `Dockerfile.project`"), not the internal
  mechanism.
- **At most ~2 sentences of detail** after the headline — the one fact a reader
  needs. No "Previously…/the gap was…/chicken-and-egg" debugging narrative; the
  *how* lives in this file, the README, and the commit body.
- **No inline file-touch lists** — git history records touched files. If a
  pointer genuinely helps, one terse trailing parenthetical (`(aic,
  post-create.py)`), never woven into sentences.
- **Past released `## [X.Y.Z]` sections are immutable** — apply this style to
  new entries only; never rewrite a shipped section (`release.yml`'s
  `github-release` job renders the GitHub Release from it).

## Workflow split rationale (so future edits don't undo it)

The split exists because the npm CLI (`aic`) is tightly coupled to the
container's filesystem (hooks, sudoers, helper-script paths). Floating
`:latest` would let the CLI and image drift out of sync. The two workflows
serve different audiences:

- `:vX.Y.Z` (immutable, from `release.yml`): what `aic init` pins by default.
  Users on a given aic version always pull the exact image that was built at
  release time. Reproducibility wins.
- `:latest` (floating, from `rebuild.yml`'s weekly cron + template pushes):
  opt-in for users who want base-layer security freshness over
  reproducibility. Not referenced by `aic init` output.

If you find yourself tempted to "simplify" by collapsing the two workflows or
re-pointing `aic init` at `:latest`, re-read the design tradeoff first.
Comparable projects (Supabase CLI, Dagger) use the same pinned model;
Earthly's floating-with-coupling model is the documented anti-pattern.

## Don't do

- **Don't weaken smoke tests** in either workflow's `smoke` job. They cover
  real security guarantees: `EXEC=0` on the socket-proxy, the `.env`
  PreToolUse hook block, scoped sudo (no arbitrary `chown`), the self-protection
  root-444 lock (`gitconfig.local` + the baked shell rc files), and the
  npm-quarantine sanity check
  (`NPM_CONFIG_MIN_RELEASE_AGE` ≤ 30 days, so npx-based MCPs stay
  installable). If a test fails legitimately, fix the regression, not the
  assertion.
- **Don't add untrusted GitHub event fields directly into `run:` blocks**
  (issue titles, PR titles, commit messages, branch refs). Use `env:` with
  proper quoting. See the GitHub Security Lab guide on workflow injection.
  Both current workflows route any ref/version through `env:` for this
  reason.
- **Don't add files to `template/`** that the user shouldn't get a copy of.
  `apply_template()` is the gatekeeper; anything that lands there gets
  copied into every project's `.devcontainer/`.
- **Don't try to edit `.devcontainer/` from inside the container.** The
  PreToolUse hook (`template/hooks/pre-tool-use.sh`) blocks writes there —
  it's part of the sandbox boundary, since an AI that can rewrite its own
  devcontainer config can disable every other protection. Edit
  `template/devcontainer.json` (and the rest of `template/`) instead; users
  pick up changes via `aic sync`. The dogfood `.devcontainer/` at the repo
  root regenerates the same way.
- **Don't bump `package.json` in a feature PR.** Version bumps are their own
  commit (created by `npm version`) so the tag points at a clean release
  commit.
- **Don't land a user-facing change without a `CHANGELOG.md` note.** When you
  add, change, fix, or remove something a user would notice (an `aic`
  flag/command, a `template/` behavior, a security fix, a default), add a bullet
  under `## [Unreleased]` in `CHANGELOG.md` in the *same* commit/PR — under the
  right Keep-a-Changelog heading (`Added`/`Changed`/`Fixed`/`Removed`). Keep
  `[Unreleased]` current so release time is just "rename the heading," not
  "reconstruct history." The changelog is hand-maintained and is a release
  precondition (CI blocks a version with no section) — see "Releasing" and
  "CHANGELOG entry style".
- **Don't force-push to `main` or rewrite tags.** GHCR has already received
  whatever the tag was bound to; ghost tags confuse users on pinned versions.
- **Don't use `git rebase -i` or other interactive git commands** from a
  non-interactive environment — they hang silently.

## Security stance

This container is a sandbox for autonomous AI tools running in
bypass-permissions / sandbox-off mode. The README's "Threat model" section is
the source of truth. When choosing between two implementations, prefer the
more restrictive one. The following files warrant extra care — any change
should be reviewed for security regressions:

- `template/Dockerfile` — particularly the sudoers, USER, and capability
  bits. Adding a new `NOPASSWD` entry is a load-bearing decision. It also bakes
  `/etc/codex/requirements.toml` (root-owned), the **managed** Codex hook that
  wires `pre-tool-use.sh` into Codex — see the `pre-tool-use.sh` note below.
  Codex installs via OpenAI's **standalone** installer
  (`chatgpt.com/codex/install.sh`), not npm — deliberate, so `codex update` works
  and it mirrors Claude's native installer; the trade-off is Codex is no longer
  under the `NPM_CONFIG_MIN_RELEASE_AGE` quarantine (still covers npx MCPs).
  OpenCode likewise installs via its standalone installer
  (`opencode.ai/install`, with `--no-modify-path`) into `~/.opencode/bin`, same
  quarantine trade-off. All three CLIs are a baked *floor* that
  `refresh_ai_tools()` floats to latest on each create (see "AI-tool refresh on
  every create").
- `template/aic-firewall` — outbound iptables allowlist. Adding hosts here
  expands what an in-container AI can reach. `cmd_enable` resolves into a
  staging ipset and `ipset swap`s it in, and **never sets `policy ACCEPT`** —
  this is what keeps re-enabling strengthen-only (it must never open a window or
  fail open on a 0-IP resolution). Don't reintroduce a flush-to-ACCEPT.
- `template/hooks/pre-tool-use.sh` — blocks reads of `.env` and other
  sensitive paths. Loosening the deny list (the `is_blocked_env` /
  `bash_touches_env` / `is_curl_pipe_sh` / `is_protected_path` matchers, or the
  `Bash|Read|Edit|Write|MultiEdit|NotebookEdit|Grep|Glob` matcher in
  `claude-settings.json`) weakens the model. The script is shared by all three
  tools: Claude registers it via `~/.claude/settings.json` (post-create), Codex
  via the **managed** `/etc/codex/requirements.toml` baked in the Dockerfile.
  Codex command hooks defined in `~/.codex/config.toml` are non-managed →
  untrusted → silently skipped in autonomous mode, so **don't** move it back
  there (a prior version did, and the hook never ran for Codex).
- `template/hooks/opencode-guardrail.js` — OpenCode's slice of that same
  guardrail. A dependency-free OpenCode plugin whose `tool.execute.before`
  translates OpenCode's `{tool, args}` into the JSON `pre-tool-use.sh` reads on
  stdin, `spawnSync`s the script, and `throw`s on exit 2. `setup_opencode()`
  wires it via `"plugin": ["/etc/aic/hooks/opencode-guardrail.js"]` (absolute
  path to the root-owned shim) in the generated `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json`
  — no trust prompt (unlike Codex), and it fires even with
  `permission."*"=allow`. Keep the logic in `pre-tool-use.sh` (single source of
  truth); the shim only maps + dispatches. Don't add a second native
  `permission` deny that could diverge. The "opencode guardrail blocks a .env
  read" smoke test guards this — extend it, don't weaken it.
- `template/aic-chown-volumes`, `template/aic-lock-gitconfig` — the only
  scripts allowed via `NOPASSWD` sudo. Touching them changes the privileged
  surface. `aic-lock-gitconfig` locks a hardcoded list to `root:root 0444`:
  `~/.gitconfig.local` **and** the baked login-shell rc files (`~/.zshrc`,
  `~/.bashrc`, fish config), so a tool session can't plant persistence that runs
  on the next `aic shell`. Keep the target list hardcoded (never argv). `aic-chown-volumes` reads project-supplied targets from
  `.devcontainer/chown-paths`, **never from argv** — that's what stops the
  `NOPASSWD` grant from becoming an arbitrary `sudo aic-chown-volumes
  /etc/sudoers.d`. The hardcoded prefix allowlist (`/workspace/`,
  `/home/vscode/.cache/`) plus `-h`/non-traversing `-R` is the boundary;
  widening it to broader `$HOME` would expose `~/.gitconfig.local` (the
  root-locked gitconfig) and is a load-bearing decision. The "scoped sudo
  cannot chown arbitrary paths" smoke test guards this — extend it, don't
  weaken it.
- `.github/workflows/*.yml` — CI secrets (`NPM_TOKEN`, GHCR via
  `GITHUB_TOKEN`). The `publish` jobs only run on push/schedule/dispatch,
  never on `pull_request`, to keep fork PRs from triggering publishes.

## Commit signing (`aic signing`)

The host signing key is never forwarded (the no-`~/.ssh`/no-agent guarantee
above), so `aic signing` provisions a *sandbox-only* ed25519 signing key in the
`aic-auth-global` volume under `~/.config/aic-auth/signing/` (key + a `mode`
marker: `auto`/`byok`/`disabled`). Load-bearing design choices, don't undo them:

- **The signing config lives inside the root-locked `~/.gitconfig.local`,
  appended by `setup_commit_signing()` *after* the host `[include]` so it
  overrides host signing — container-only; the host gitconfig stays RO.** Keep
  it in that one file: the existing "self-protection files are root-owned 0444"
  smoke test then still covers it, and an in-session tool can't inject
  `credential.helper` via a separate unlocked include.
- **Applied on (re)create only, never live.** `~/.gitconfig.local` is rewritten
  fresh each creation and re-locked; a `mode` change takes effect on the next
  `aic rebuild`. This is deliberate — a live edit would need a privileged
  *unlock* of the locked file, which a compromised session could abuse before
  the next re-lock. Don't add an unlock primitive to "make it instant".
- **`aic signing`'s mutating actions are unprivileged** — they `devcontainer
  exec` as `vscode` (so the key gets correct owner + 0600), needing the
  container up; no sudoers/NOPASSWD entry is involved. `status` reads the volume
  host-side and works anytime. Generating the key in-container (not host-side)
  is what keeps perms/ownership correct across the Linux UID-remap.
- **`--register` writes to the user's GitHub account** (`gh api POST
  /user/ssh_signing_keys`) and is opt-in only — never auto-register.
- The "aic signing wires a sandbox signing key" smoke test (both workflows)
  stages a key, recreates, and asserts signing is wired *and* `~/.gitconfig.local`
  is still `root 444`. Extend it, don't weaken the root-lock assertion.

## Verifying changes locally

The CI smoke tests run inside a real devcontainer. Approximate that locally
to avoid pushing broken changes:

```bash
mkdir -p /tmp/aic-test && cd /tmp/aic-test
git init -q
AIC_HOME=/path/to/aicontainer-checkout /path/to/aicontainer-checkout/aic init --build
devcontainer up --workspace-folder .
devcontainer exec --workspace-folder . claude --version
devcontainer exec --workspace-folder . curl -fsS http://socket-proxy:2375/_ping
# npm quarantine sanity (must be ≤ 30 days or npx-based MCPs fail to install)
devcontainer exec --workspace-folder . bash -lc 'echo "$NPM_CONFIG_MIN_RELEASE_AGE"'
```

For CLI-only changes, exercising `aic init` against a temp directory and
inspecting the generated `.devcontainer/` is usually enough:

```bash
TMP=$(mktemp -d) && cd "$TMP" && git init -q
AIC_HOME=/path/to/aicontainer-checkout /path/to/aicontainer-checkout/aic init
grep "image:" .devcontainer/docker-compose.yml   # should show :vX.Y.Z, not :latest
```
